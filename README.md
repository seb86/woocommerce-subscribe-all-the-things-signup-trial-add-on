This is an addon extension for [WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things](https://github.com/Prospress/woocommerce-subscribe-all-the-things) currently in development.

> Please note: This extension is still being tested as WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things is still in development.

The goal of the extension is to provide additional subscription options, allowing you to add a sign-up fee and/or a free trial to the subscription options.

This works with all supported product types in WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things.
